Movie Fantasy League


I want to create a fantasy movie league app. 

Fantasy Movie League: This is like fantasy sports but for movies - users create leagues, draft movies, earn points based on box office performance

Core Features Needed:

User accounts/authentication
League creation and management
Movie data integration
Drafting system
Scoring based on box office
Leaderboards/rankings
Real-time updates
Technical Requirements:

Backend for data storage (users, leagues, movies, scores)
API endpoints for CRUD operations
Real-time features for live updates
Movie data integration (box office APIs)
Project Type: This is clearly a web application that needs backend functionality for data persistence, user management, and real-time features.

Things needed on backend:

Database for users, leagues, movies, scores
Authentication system
API endpoints
Real-time updates
File storage for user avatars
